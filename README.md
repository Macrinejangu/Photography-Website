## Description

**Shutter Souls** is a minimalist, cinematic photography portfolio that reflects emotion, culture, and storytelling. Built using only HTML and CSS, the project showcases a gallery of striking images, an introductory paragraph, a personal biography, and a contact form â€” all within a clean, responsive layout.
